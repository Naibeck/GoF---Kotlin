# GoF - Kotlin
This project is to show a simple usage of [Gang of Fours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by writting them on Kotlin and trying to think an idiomatic kotlin alternative.

Each pattern design type is stored on its own package (creational, structural and behavioral) and each pattern is contained by its own package e.g. (creational.builder).
